At this point, I am fully engrossed in the world of tech and software development. My apologies if I am using misnomers - as with any self-respecting field of work, you need complicated jargon that is easy to get wrong.

Regardless of my lack of my understanding of the nuance that lies within software development, I am really enjoying the field! 'Coding' is the primary action with which one makes things tick in tech. Being around 'coding' necessitated a knowledge thereof and below lies a bit of my journey towards (trying to) undestand it.

## First brush

UCT's _CSC1006F_ was the first time I learned to code. It was course taught in Python and covered the nuts and bolts - `variables`,`for loops`, `arrays`, `recursion` and the like. Not to toot my own horn, but I ended up doing really well in this course.

Initially it was _incredibly_ difficult - like learning how to think, from scratch. But as the neurons in my brain reshuffled, my enjoyment grew and the course gradually relented in its pressures.

## Continued development (haha)

Over the rest of my university career I had continual but shallow interactions with coding. My exposure ranged from using _R_ in statistics courses to _Matlab_ in financial mathematics course. (I also enrolled in an additional computer science course, dealing with similar subject matter to the aforementioned _CSC1006F_ but in _Javascript_).

Each of these encounters was well enjoyed but I failed to make a pretty glaring conclusion - I should go into tech. For the rest of university and into my first job, I always sought roles jobs that looked like developer work in finance. In hindsight, I should have cut out the middle man and sought developer work full stop.

## Finally in the weeds

Joining an insurtech startup at the beginning of 2023 finally put me in front of people who were coding for a living.
