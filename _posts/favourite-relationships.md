## My lifelong bestfriend

Strange, strange character he is. But with a massive heart. My lifelong bestfriend is someone I was incredibly close with growing up. We have come a long way since meeting as babies. Our relationship shows to me the value of walking a long road together - there have been times when we have not been as strong and that's what makes us strong. He knows me incredibly well and I am proud to know him.

He's really weird.

## My varsity best friend

Someone for whom I have the utmost respect. Our times at university were difficult - long days spent on campus tackling problems that seemed far beyond our capabilties. I have always admired my varsity bestfriend - he has awesome ambition and a ferocious drive and a wicked sense of humour to boot.

He also happens to be really weird.

## My brother

Simply put, a clone of me (but far more impressive). The bearing my brother's wellbeing has on me is hard to overstate - I care about him deeply and frantically. The way we get on is a truly special thing and we are frighteningly in-sync (to the irritation of those in our presence, at times).

He is also pretty weird.

## My mother

It feels a pretty strange thing to say but my mother and I are really good friends. I admire her greatly and I strive to be half the person she is. Our values are well-aligned and we just seem to get on really well. I am my mother's son and it makes me incredibly proud to say so.

She is not that weird.

## My girlfriend

It is a great privelege to be able to share a connection with someone that is both incredibly enjoyable as well as emotionally supportive. I often find myself a little astounded at just how well my girlfriend and I get on - it feels effortless. We laugh together _all_ the time. Somehow, though, this is complemented by a personal bond in which I feel an inordinate sense of comfort and confidence.

We have gone on an interesting and, at times, challenging path together. I have never doubted my feelings or questioned what we were doing. Not once. I have always scoffed at the idea of rearranging one's life for another person. Since meeting my girlfriend, that idea seems a lot less crazy.

She is only a little weird.
